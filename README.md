This explains how to setup a headless pi, how to setup aravis, this project and make it so the project runs on boot with no interaction

## Pi setup and connection
This section explains how to setup a blank sd card and Pi4 as a headless Pi you can SSH into

- Flash OS using Raspbian Imager. You can specify the name and password of your wifi hotspot before flashing, so that the Pi will be able to access the network.
- Unplug and replug into PC
- Go to boot partition (bootfs) (NOT root/boots), to create files, by

`cd /media/USERNAME/bootfs`

- Create a blank file `ssh.txt`, by

`touch ssh.txt`

- Create a file `wpa_supplicant.conf` by

`sudo nano wpa_supplicant.conf`

Write the following:
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB

network={
	ssid="WiFi SSID"
	psk="WPA/WPA2 passphrase"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
- Insert SD card into Pi and power on, wait until Pi turns up as connected on hotspot 

- Find IP address of Pi :

`ping raspberrypi.local`

- SSH to Pi:

`ssh pi@IP`

## Project setup
- First create a virtual python environment where all python and pip commands must be run:

`python3 -m venv bee-venv`

- Activate the virtual environment:

`source bee-venv/bin/activate`

- Ensure 'apt' utility is up-to-date:

`sudo apt-get update`

- Clone the 'bee_track' repo:

`git clone https://github.com/SheffieldMLtracking/bee_track.git`

- *Clone the retrodetect repo:*

`git clone https://github.com/SheffieldMLtracking/btretrodetect.git`

- Run `aravissetup` from the root directory

`source bee_track/aravissetup`
, entering "y" when prompted

This should install any dependencies needed for aravis, clone aravis, setup, build and install it ready to be used.

- THEN install python dependencies in the venv:

`pip install -r bee_track/requirements.txt` *NB, 16/05/25: switched to old version of PyGObject*

This must be done after running `aravissetup` because some of the python modules rely on some of the installs when installing aravis.

*Before we can run btretrodetect, we need to give it an offset file so it knows how to translate between monochrom and colour camera coordinates. We will work out the true offset later, but for now we need to give it a dummy file so it doesn't crash on boot:*
-*Create the necessary directory:*

`mkdir /home/pi/.btretrodetect`

- *Create a blank offset file:*

`sudo nano /home/pi/.btretrodetect/offset.json`

- *Now paste the following text and save the file:*

```
{"all": [0, 0]}
```

- Set the device ID file: make a new file called 'device_id.txt' in the `~/bee_track/webinterface` folder:

`sudo nano ~/bee_track/webinterface/device_id.txt`

In the new file write a single number identifying the box, on a single line line (e.g. `1015`).


### Running Beetrack on Boot automatically
To run the project on a headless pi with no interaction you must complete the following steps. Bear in mind it takes a good 3-5 minutes to get up and running every boot.

It looks as though the latest version of the Raspberry Pi OS no longer uses  `etc/rc.local` and `etc/network/interfaces`, so we will reinstate them ourselves. (In the long term, we should look into a better way to do this.)

- Create rc.local file:

`sudo nano /etc/rc.local`

- Paste the following text into file:
  
```
#!/bin/sh
# add your commands
# call your scripts here
su - pi -c /home/pi/bee_track/startup &
/home/pi/bee_track/startupssh
# last line must be exit 0
exit 0
```
*Note that this both starts beetrack on startup, and starts autossh to establish a connection to the AWS server (see section below). If you do not need the autossh connection, delete the line `/home/pi/bee_track/startupssh`*

- Set permissions:

`sudo chmod -v +x /etc/rc.local`

- Enable rc.local:

`sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service`

- Download etc/network/interfaces:

`sudo apt install ifupdown net-tools`

- Now edit file by:

`sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`

- ... add the following, then save and exit:

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 169.254.160.220
```

- When you reboot (`sudo reboot`), the project should run without any interaction. You can reboot now, or continue with the following sections before rebooting.


### Setting up autossh

We use autossh to establish a connection to our AWS server. This is used to allow us to access the boxes remotely and for the automatic data backup pipeline. We also use ssh connections to remotely use the web interface to control boxes.

If you need to access or backup boxes remotely, follow these steps:

- Install autossh:

`sudo apt install autossh`

- If you did not already do so in the previous step, edit `rc.local` to add the following line before `exit 0`:
```
/home/pi/bee_track/startupssh
```

Edit startupssh by

`sudo nano /home/pi/bee_track/startupssh`

- Edit the file to read:
```
sleep 30
autossh -f -R 5003:localhost:22 ohio@iot.bugtrack.org.uk -i/home/pi/.ssh/KEYFILE.pem -N -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
autossh -f -R 8003:localhost:8000 ohio@iot.bugtrack.org.uk -i/home/pi/.ssh/KEYFILE.pem -N -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
autossh -f -R 6003:localhost:5000 ohio@iot.bugtrack.org.uk -i/home/pi/.ssh/KEYFILE.pem -N -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

Replace `KEYFILE.pem` with the name of the keyfile we use to ssh to the AWS server.

Replace `5003`, `8003` and `6003` with port numbers that are unique to your box, so that we can establish connections to multiple boxes.

*I have been using the following pattern: each box is identified by a four digit number, e.g. `1035`. For port 22, add 4000, to get e.g. `5035`. For port 8000, add 7000, to get e.g. `8035`. For port 5000, add 5000, to get e.g. `6035`*

- Set permissions:

`sudo chmod 755 /home/pi/bee_track/startupssh`

- Ensure you are in the home directory (`cd`). Try to navigate to '.ssh' directory by

`cd .ssh`. If directory does not exist, create it by `mkdir .ssh`, then navigate to it by `cd .ssh`.

- Get key file for AWS server. *I'm not going to publicly post instructions for that, so contact Mike or Joe if you need access.*

- Set permissions:

`chmod 400 KEYFILE.pem`


### Adding further wifi networks

We typically set up our Pis to automatically join a wifi hotspot to give us local network access, by specifying this when flishing with Raspberry Pi imager. You may also want the boxes to automatically join other networks if they are available. For example, our Ohio boxes join the University network.

- The simplest way to do this is via the network manager, which you call by:

`sudo nmtui`

Follow the GUI menu  system to create a new wifi connection and specify the network name and password.


## If you want to make edits

You will probably want to reinstall with git an editable version:

- First do "beetrack": 

(bee-venv)$ `pip uninstall bee_track`

(bee-venv)$ `cd ~/bee_track`

(bee-venv)$ `pip install -e .`

- Now do the same for "btretrodetect": 

(bee-venv)$ `pip uninstall btretrodetect`

(bee-venv)$ `cd ~/btretrodetect`

(bee-venv)$ `pip install -e .`

*Temporarily, we need to make a edit to beetrack to allow it to import btretrodetect. In the future we will update bee_track so this is not necessary, but I don't want to do this while Mike is still working on btretrodetect*

*Edit "core.py":*

`sudo nano ~/bee_track/bee_track/core.py`

*Find the line that reads: `import retrodetect as rd`*
*Replace with:*

`import btretrodetect as rd`

### Now reboot the pi: Bee_track should start automatically

`sudo reboot`


# Running Beetrack from command line

- Make sure you are in virtual environment where all the installs have occured

`source bee-venv/bin/activate`

- Go to bee_track directory:

`cd bee_track`

- Start ethernet connection to camereas:

`sudo ifconfig eth0 up 169.254.160.220`

- Check cameras are working:

`arv-camera-test-0.10`

- Start bee_track:

`./startupfast`

- If something goes wrong use:

`killall python3`

- Connect to Pi with:

http://raspberrypi.local:8000/


# Manual Setup

## Python Setup

In root directory of the pi (or create project dir with all files in)
`git clone https://github.com/lionfish0/bee_track.git`

Setup virtual environment
`python -m venv bee-venv`

Activate - (if using SSH terminal to change python env)
Make sure all commands are run in the virtual environment from now on
`source bee-venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -e bee_track/.`
`sudo apt install libatlas3-base`


## Aravis setup

`git clone https://github.com/AravisProject/aravis.git`

# Architecture

This is a simplified overview of the different parts of this system and how they communicate.

```mermaid

backend[API\nFlask app\nbee_track/core.py]
frontend[Javascript GUI\nhttp.server\nwebinterface/]
user <--"HTTP 80" --> frontend
frontend <--"HTTP 5000"--> backend
```

## API architecture

The Flask application has four components which run in separate threads:

- Cameras
- Triggers
- Rotation
- Tracking

Each thread has a worker process with a configuration message queue.

## Virtual environment

These are instructions for running the API app on a virtual Raspberry Pi machine using [dockerpi](https://github.com/lukechilds/dockerpi).

1. Install Docker
2. Download the latest stable [Raspberry Pi OS Lite image](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)
3. Decompress the image `unxz *.xz`
4. Run a virtual machine (`p3` means Rasp. Pi version 3, which is under experimental support)

```bash
image_path="./2023-12-11-raspios-bookworm-arm64-lite.img"
docker run -it -v $image_path:/sdcard/filesystem.img lukechilds/dockerpi:vm p3
```

TODO this doesn't work


## Old instructions for setting up bee-track to run on boot. Saved for now but currently superceded by section above.
- Edit rc.local by

`sudo nano /etc/rc.local`

- Add the following line:

`su - pi -c /home/pi/bee_track/startup &`

Before exit 0

- Add the following to `/etc/network/interfaces`

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 169.254.160.220
```

* We can create and enable `rc.local` ourselves, but I haven't yet figured out how to re-enable `etc/network/interfaces`. Instead, I am using `rc.local` to establish the ethernet connection for the cameras on startup:*

- *Create `rc.local` file:*

`sudo nano /etc/rc.local`


- *Write in the following:*
```
#!/bin/sh
# add your commands
# call your scripts here
ifconfig eth0 up 169.254.160.220
su - pi -c /home/pi/bee_track/startup &
/home/pi/bee_track/startupssh
# last line must be exit 0
exit 0
```
*Note that this does three things: it replaces `etc/network/interfaces` to configure the ethernet connection; it starts beetrack on startup; and it starts autossh to establish a connection to the AWS server (see section below). If you do not need the autossh connection, delete the line `/home/pi/bee_track/startupssh`*

- *Set permissions:*

`sudo chmod -v +x /etc/rc.local`

- *Enable `rc.local`:*

`sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service`

- When you reboot (`sudo reboot`), the project should run without any interaction. You can reboot now, or continue with the following sections before rebooting.
